Add an empty GameObject to the scene and add the Script Component: RSCModelHandler\r\nThis GameObject can be placed anywhere on the scene.\r\n\r\n2. Add an empty GameObject to the scene and add the Script Component: RSCModelRenderer\r\nAfter step #2. Change the settings of the RSCModelRenderer script's \"Model Name\" parameter to a modelname of choice, eg. **tree** Note: Place this GameObject anywhere you like this model to be rendered and change the Scale if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture updates will include:\r\nLandscape Manager (Load, Edit and Save Sections)\r\nAnd much more, for what I get time to do.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
