Add an empty GameObject to the scene and add the Script Component: RSCModelHandler\r\nThis GameObject can be placed anywhere on the scene.\r\n\r\n2. Add an empty GameObject to the scene and add the Script Component: RSCModelRenderer\r\nAfter step #2. Change the settings of the RSCModelRenderer script's \"Model Name\" parameter to a modelname of choice, eg. **tree** Note: Place this GameObject anywhere you like this model to be rendered and change the Scale if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture updates will include:\r\n* RSCTextureHandler\r\nTexture loading, used for both models, walls, floors and roofs.\r\n\r\n* RSCLandscapeHandler\r\nSection and area loading and editing. It will be used as a *Unity Terrain*\r\n\r\n* RSCSpriteHandler\r\nSprite loading, used for billboards, players, npcs, items and ui\r\n\r\nMoste of the code is already done, just need to adjust it to work with unity. It will come along soon enough :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
