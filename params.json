Add an empty GameObject to the scene and add the Script Component: RSCModelHandler\r\nThis GameObject can be placed anywhere on the scene.\r\n\r\n2. Add an empty GameObject to the scene and add the Script Component: RSCModelRenderer\r\nAfter step #2. Change the settings of the RSCModelRenderer script's \"Model Name\" parameter to a modelname of choice, eg. **tree** Note: Place this GameObject anywhere you like this model to be rendered and change the Scale if necessary.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Future updates will include**\r\n* **RSCLandscapeHandler** -\r\n_Section and area loading and editing. It will be used as a *Terrain*_\r\n\r\n* **RSCTextureHandler** -\r\n_Texture loading, used for both models, walls, floors and roofs._\r\n\r\n* **RSCSpriteHandler** -\r\n_Sprite loading, used for billboards, players, npcs, items and ui_\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nMoste of the code is already done, just need to adjust it to work with unity. It will come along soon enough :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
